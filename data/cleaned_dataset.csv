WHY WILLIAMSBURG?

Williamsburg is FABULOUS. It's fast growing and it's fast changing. It's hip. In the 1960's the new and exciting place where culture was blooming was Greenwich Village. In the 70's the SOHO neighborhood was where cheap industrial loft space were being turned into places where the adventurous could move to New York, live cheaply and make the new art, music, and culture. These days Williamsburg has that special chemistry of the New York that's constantly renewing itself.

We are David and Janet. 

We hope you have checked out one of the many stories written about our home online and we welcome the opportunity to share it with you. 

A little about us and the home ...

David is a seasoned New Yorker with roots on the lower east side and has lived in this area of Brooklyn for about 20 years. Janet is more recently relocated to Brooklyn from Philadelphia, though roots with David go back to childhood days. We are newlyweds as of July 11, 2015

The building received its C of O in 2013 after many challenges from NYC's department of buildings. You can read or listen to the story online. We are Brooklyn's and NYC's first shipping container home. NPR Science Friday has a lovely interview with David and late wife and architect, Michele Bertomen.

We like to leave people alone unless they need us. But we are around all the time and live on the second and third floor. Our Giant dog, Mormon, is very gentle and a fully trained therapy dog.  If you have any concerns about dogs, I will refer you to our reviews. 

We hope that we can offer a comfortable, safe home away from home in the heart of trendy Brooklyn.

Covid-19 Vaccination is a requirement for booking with us.

Alongside Central Park, between 5th and Lexington avenues, up to East 96th Street, the trappings of wealth are everywhere apparent: posh buildings, Madison Avenue's flagship boutiques, and doormen in braided livery. It’s also a key destination for visitors, because some of the most fantastic museums in the country are here.<br /><br />There's a reason this stretch of Manhattan is called ""Museum Mile"": this is where you'll find the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, as well as a number of art galleries. For a local taste of the luxe life, catwalk down Madison Avenue for its lavish boutiques; strolling the platinum-card corridor between 60th and 82nd street is like stepping into the pages of a glossy magazine.

Alongside Central Park, between 5th and Lexington avenues, up to East 96th Street, the trappings of wealth are everywhere apparent: posh buildings, Madison Avenue's flagship boutiques, and doormen in braided livery. It’s also a key destination for visitors, because some of the most fantastic museums in the country are here.<br /><br />There's a reason this stretch of Manhattan is called ""Museum Mile"": this is where you'll find the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, as well as a number of art galleries. For a local taste of the luxe life, catwalk down Madison Avenue for its lavish boutiques; strolling the platinum-card corridor between 60th and 82nd street is like stepping into the pages of a glossy magazine.

Thanks for checking my profile. I manage furnished monthly rentals and co-living spaces in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn with my team members. I have been managing furnished apartments for a decade and have had more than 5,600 guests from 90 countries so far. Please feel free to ask me any questions or requests!

*I can speak Japanese as well! Please feel free to contact me in Japanese.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) Growing Our Alumni Community:
We don’t require any extra/hidden fees to maximize our profits. Instead, our focus is on growing our alumni community. We believe that our services and fair pricing speak for themselves among our guests. Our alumni posted 700+ reviews from 2019 to 2021. What’s more, 80% of the reviews gave us five stars and 97% awarded more than four stars. Our alumni community spans the globe with 87 unique nationalities, and it has been expanding. We look forward to serving all our new guests: our alumni of tomorrow.
‍

‍2) Transparency. One All-Inclusive Price. That’s What We’re About:
There’s no math required. The price for our one-month minimum stay is simple and fair, no matter how long you stay with us. Our one-month price is already competitive (averaging $1,200 to $2,200, with 80% of our 150 rooms under $1,900 per month), compared to others’ discounted prices for three- to six-month stays. In 2020, 50%+ of our customers extended their original stay by a few months. There’s really no substitute for all-inclusive furnished rentals and a co-living environment, with a furnished private room, that’s ready for you on day one.
‍

‍3) Increasing Value for the Local Property Industry:
We provide co-living communities for our guests by helping property owners draw more value from under-managed residential properties. We care about our customer community, of course, but we’re also excited about uniting property owners, vendors, and our team on one digital platform.
‍

‍4) Privacy Is the Priority:
There are no required social events. Our priority is providing privacy, a quiet environment, and security for all our guests. Our team will take care of cleaning the common spaces every week, so that our kitchen/dining areas are always comfortable. But if you want to expand your network or social circle, our office at WeWork offers you day/after-work communities. We just moved our headquarters to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, which is easily accessible by all subway lines.


‍5) 10 Years Perfecting the Co-Living Mindset:
Our founder started this business in his apartment after he couldn’t find appropriately priced accommodation for his first three months in New York. But our whole team has experienced co-living firsthand, so we understand what the customer feels and will need next. “We live and breathe co-living: first as roommates, and now serving our co-living guests.”
‍

‍6) A Sustainable Business Model in the Sharing Economy:
We won’t invest in luxury buildings like hotels or event spaces. We rent existing empty apartments and townhouses from the owners, put IKEA-type furniture in, and list the clean rooms on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from guests being charged fair prices and the revenue owners receive. However, what drives our growth is not the number of rooms, but our deep understanding of how to care for guests and rooms 24/7, and the intangible value within them.
‍

‍7) Our Vision - Making Dreams Come True:
CrossOver’s goal is to help our guests achieve their goals and dreams by providing the most affordable and flexible housing environment available. But it doesn’t stop here. Our guests’ dreams are expanding to a variety of locations around the globe, and CrossOver will be right there with them—powering the dreams of residents, landlords, and our staff in the wider world.",within an hour,99%,71%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/73292192-0a69-4f4e-b25c-6bf293912e9b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/73292192-0a69-4f4e-b25c-6bf293912e9b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Harlem,151.0,366.0,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Upper East Side,Manhattan,40.76164,-73.96633,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,3,1.0,1 bath,1.0,2.0,"[""Clothing storage"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Bathtub"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Microwave"", ""Iron"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Rice maker"", ""Host greets you"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Wifi"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Oven"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Stove"", ""Heating"", ""Hot water"", ""Hangers"", ""Air conditioning"", ""City skyline view"", ""Bed linens"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Free dryer \u2013 In building"", ""TV"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Kitchen"", ""Free washer \u2013 In building""]",237.0,30,365,30.0,30.0,365.0,365.0,30.0,365.0,,t,8,38,68,166,2025-10-02,18,4,1,69,4,240,56880.0,2021-06-05,2025-09-22,4.89,4.94,4.89,5.0,5.0,4.83,4.39,,f,150,16,134,0,0.34,237.0,199,0.5452054794520548,4.08,0,1,4.848571428571428,34,2021-06-05,1616

During the 1840s and 1850s it grew slowly inland from the ferry landing at the foot of Astoria Boulevard (where an early settlement was known as Hallett's Cove). Wealthy New Yorkers built mansions on 12th and 14th streets and on 27th Avenue. The German United Cabinet Workers brought four farms in 1869 between 35th and 50th streets and developed a German town.
